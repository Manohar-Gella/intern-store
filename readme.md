## About Gella Job Info

In the vast universe of computer science careers, finding the right path can sometimes feel like debugging without Stack Overflow. That's why I created Gella Job Info. It's an open-source platform where you can discover various career options, learn about different roles, and maybe even find that elusive internship or job. Whether you're exploring potential career paths, seeking internships, or planning your next career move, Gella Job Info is here to assist you.

### Why Gella Job Info?

- **For Students, By a Student**: Created by a computer science student who knows the struggle.
- **Open Source**: Contributions are welcome! Share your resources and help others.
- **Memes**: Because job hunting shouldn't always be serious. Laugh a little!
